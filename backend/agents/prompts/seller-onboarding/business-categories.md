# Business Category Risk Profiles

## High-Risk Categories (Enhanced Due Diligence Required)
These categories have elevated fraud rates and require comprehensive verification.

- **Cryptocurrency / Digital Assets:** High money laundering risk, regulatory complexity. Require: enhanced KYC, source of funds verification, ongoing monitoring.
- **Adult Content / Services:** High chargeback rates, regulatory restrictions. Require: age verification infrastructure, content compliance checks.
- **Gambling / Gaming Credits:** Money laundering channel, regulatory licensing needed. Require: license verification, transaction monitoring.
- **Pharmaceuticals / Supplements:** Counterfeit risk, health safety concerns. Require: license verification, supply chain documentation.
- **Dropshipping (declared):** Quality control issues, fulfillment delays, high dispute rates. Require: supplier verification, shipping SLA commitments.
- **Firearms / Weapons:** Strict regulatory compliance needed. Require: FFL verification (US), export control checks.
- **CBD / Cannabis:** Legal status varies by jurisdiction. Require: jurisdiction-specific compliance verification.

## Medium-Risk Categories (Standard+ Verification)
- **Electronics:** High-value items attractive to fraudsters. Watch for: pricing significantly below market, bulk listings of latest devices.
- **Luxury Goods / Designer Items:** Counterfeit risk. Watch for: inconsistent pricing, lack of authenticity documentation, seller location inconsistent with supply chain.
- **Event Tickets:** Scalping and counterfeit tickets. Watch for: volume of listings, pricing patterns, delivery method.
- **Gift Cards / Stored Value:** Money laundering vehicle. Watch for: bulk purchases, resale patterns, source verification.
- **Automotive Parts:** Safety concerns with counterfeits. Watch for: pricing anomalies, brand inconsistencies.

## Low-Risk Categories (Standard Verification)
- **Books, Media, Music:** Low fraud rates, low average transaction value.
- **Clothing & Apparel (non-luxury):** Moderate return rates but low fraud.
- **Home & Garden:** Generally legitimate sellers, moderate risk.
- **Toys & Games:** Seasonal patterns but generally low risk.

## Category-Specific Decision Guidance
- For HIGH risk categories: minimum verification strategy should be COMPREHENSIVE (all tools run).
- For MEDIUM risk: STANDARD strategy is sufficient unless other risk signals are present.
- For LOW risk: BASIC strategy is acceptable for established-looking sellers.
- A seller in a HIGH risk category with a clean verification should still get APPROVE — category risk elevates scrutiny, not the decision itself.
