# Common Fraud Typologies

## First-Party Fraud
The seller or buyer themselves commit fraud, not an external attacker.
- **Friendly fraud / chargeback abuse:** Legitimate purchase followed by false dispute. Look for: repeat dispute history, disputes filed after delivery confirmation, disputes on digital goods.
- **Return fraud:** Returning used, stolen, or counterfeit items. Look for: high return rates, returns of different items than ordered, wardrobing patterns.
- **Promotion abuse:** Creating multiple accounts to exploit signup bonuses or coupons. Look for: shared device fingerprints, similar email patterns, same payment methods across accounts.

## Third-Party Fraud
An external actor uses stolen or fabricated credentials.
- **Stolen identity:** Real person's documents used without consent. Look for: address mismatches with credit bureau, unusual login locations, sudden behavior change on established accounts.
- **Synthetic identity:** Fabricated identity combining real and fake data. Look for: thin credit file, no social media presence, SSN issued recently or to different age range, pristine credit history with no normal usage patterns.
- **Account takeover (ATO):** Legitimate account hijacked. Look for: password reset followed by immediate high-value activity, new device + new shipping address, email or phone number change followed by large transactions.

## Organized Fraud
Coordinated fraud involving multiple actors or accounts.
- **Fraud rings:** Multiple accounts operated by same group. Look for: shared attributes (IP, device, address, phone), coordinated timing of activity, similar listing patterns.
- **Money laundering:** Using the platform to move illicit funds. Look for: rapid buy-sell cycles with minimal margin, transactions with no economic rationale, sellers in high-risk jurisdictions with unusual volume.
- **Collusion:** Buyer and seller working together. Look for: reciprocal transactions, artificially inflated prices, no genuine shipping activity.

## Platform-Specific Fraud
Fraud targeting marketplace mechanics.
- **Dropship fraud:** Seller lists items they don't possess, ships from third party. Look for: shipping from different location than seller address, long fulfillment times, tracking numbers from retail stores.
- **Counterfeit goods:** Selling fake branded items. Look for: prices significantly below market, generic product photos, seller location inconsistent with brand distribution.
- **Review manipulation:** Fake reviews to boost reputation. Look for: burst of positive reviews in short window, reviewer accounts with thin history, identical review language patterns.
