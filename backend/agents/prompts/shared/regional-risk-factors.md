# Regional Risk Factors

## High-Risk Jurisdictions
These regions have elevated fraud rates or regulatory concerns. Apply enhanced due diligence.
- **FATF Grey List countries:** Increased monitoring for money laundering. Check current FATF list for updates.
- **Sanctioned jurisdictions:** OFAC, EU, UN sanctions lists. Any match is a hard block — cannot approve.
- **Fraud hotspot regions:** Certain regions have disproportionate fraud origination rates. This is a risk factor, not a block — always combine with other signals.

## Cross-Border Risk
International transactions carry inherent additional risk.
- **Currency mismatch:** Seller in Country A, pricing in Country B's currency without clear business reason.
- **Shipping destination vs seller location:** Large geographic distance between seller and shipping origin may indicate dropshipping or triangulation fraud.
- **Time zone inconsistencies:** Account activity patterns inconsistent with claimed location.

## Document Verification by Region
Document reliability varies significantly by country.
- **Tier 1 (most reliable):** US, UK, EU, Canada, Australia, Japan — standardized documents, strong verification databases.
- **Tier 2 (reliable with caveats):** Brazil, India, Mexico, South Africa — valid documents but verification databases may be incomplete.
- **Tier 3 (enhanced verification needed):** Countries with less standardized document systems — require additional verification steps like video KYC or utility bill verification.

## Regulatory Context
Different regions have different compliance requirements.
- **EU/UK:** GDPR data handling, PSD2 strong customer authentication, 5AMLD/6AMLD anti-money laundering.
- **US:** BSA/AML requirements, state-specific money transmitter laws, FCRA for credit data.
- **APAC:** Varied — Singapore has strict AML, others may have less developed frameworks. Apply the strictest applicable standard.
